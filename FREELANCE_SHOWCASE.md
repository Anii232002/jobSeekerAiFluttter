# Job Finder AI - Project Showcase

## Professional Summary

**Job Finder AI** is a next-generation mobile application that leverages **Artificial Intelligence** to revolutionize the job search experience. By utilizing advanced algorithms to analyze user profiles and market trends, the application dramatically streamlines the discovery process, intelligently surfacing the most relevant opportunities to candidates.

Built with a unified codebase using **Flutter**, the application delivers a premium, native-grade experience on both iOS and Android. It features a sleek, dark-themed UI designed for prolonged usage, ensuring that the tech-driven core is matched by an intuitive and engaging frontend.

At its core, the system is powered by a robust and high-concurrency backend engineered in **Go (Golang)**. This architecture ensures low-latency response times and scalable data processing, capable of handling complex AI-driven search queries and high user traffic with ease. The backend infrastructure is deployed on **Amazon EC2**, leveraging AWS's reliability to ensure 24/7 availability and secure data management.

Key technical highlights include:
*   **AI-Powered Search**: Intelligent algorithms that streamline job discovery and matching.
*   **Frontend**: Flutter (Dart) with Provider for efficient state management and reactive UI updates.
*   **Backend**: High-performance Go server handling API requests, AI processing logic, and data aggregation.
*   **Infrastructure**: Hosted on Amazon EC2 for scalable, enterprise-grade cloud performance.
*   **Integration**: Seamless RESTful API communication between the mobile client and the cloud server.

This project demonstrates end-to-end full-stack development capability, combining a polished frontend user experience with a powerful, systems-level backend solution.
